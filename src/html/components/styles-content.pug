      p.styles-content__text Stretching classes include complex exercises to develop the elasticity of muscles, ligaments and tendons of the whole body. The higher the elasticity, the greater the amplitude of the movements performed, and this gives additional opportunities to perform more complex dance movements. Therefore, stretching is so necessary for dancers of various styles! Stretching is no less necessary in sports. Any athlete knows that without stretching the body will look "wooden", and movements are constrained. By neglecting to perform even elementary stretching exercises after strength training, you noticeably distance yourself from the goal of forming a beautiful and healthy body. Flexibility is youth! With age, the ability to flexibility fades, the elasticity of ligaments and tendons is lost, the amplitude of movement decreases. But if you add stretching exercises to your daily activity, then every person will feel healthier and younger over time. Therefore, we invite everyone, of any age, level or type of activity to stretching classes!
